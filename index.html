                Last chart illustrates what these satellites are used for. Satellites are shown in packed circle and first grouped by its purpose. We can see that some of the important
                areas in which satellites are used for are Communications, Earth Observation like weather prediction, navigation, space observation, space sciences etc. Satellites are 
                then grouped by its orbit type, these includes but not limited to equatorial, sun-synchronus, polar, non-polar inclined and there are some satellites that do not have 
                fixed orbit type and can be manuevered as needed. These satellites falls under none category as shown in the chart.

                  Satellites are further classified into third group which is its orbit class. There are LEO,GEO, MEO and elliptical. LEO is short for low earth orbit. 
                  These satellites orbit between 160 and 2,000 km above earth. MEO is short for medium earth orbit and altitude is between 2,000 and 35,786km. GEO stands for 
                  geosynchronous, or geostationary earth orbit and these satellites for higher than 35,786 km above earth's surface. You can zoom on this just by clicking on 
                  circles. Similarly you can zoom out by clicking anywhere on circle.

                In the next slide, we will see how the Apogee and Perigee of these satellites compares which will give some understanding of how these satellites orbit and what purpose
                they are used for. Apogee and Perigee are helpful to calculate and identify the orbit type of a satellite. So lets take a look...

          <h4>Satellites Apogee Vs Perigee</h4>

              In last chart we see how apogee and perigee are compared for all satellites. Apogee and Perigee are terms which describe aspects of an elliptical orbit of satellites.
              Apogee is the distance when a satellite is at farthest from the Earth and Perigee is the distance when a satellite is at the closest distance from the Earth. 
              These satellites are classified by the purpose it is used for so user can easily distinguish about a particular type of satellite by clicking on label signs.
              This Chart gives us good understanding of how satellites orbits around the Earth and how its path will look like.

                Majority of the the satellites have Apogee less than 50,000 km and perigee less than 5,000 km and this is why many satellites data points are concentrated around the 
                origin in the chart. Another observation from the chart is satellites used for Space Science have very high apogee and perigee which makes sense as these satellites scan 
                larger portion of the solar system and universe for exploration. Satellites used for communications and navigation also have higher apogee and perigee compares to satellites 
                used for earth observation. Users can use the legend to filter the data points. In the next screen, let's see how the world has made progess and what coutries have there 
                satellites orbiting the earth...

            <h4>So what happened in last 4-5 decades...</h4>
            <p><iframe class="juxtapose" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=03d44e24-e16f-11e5-a524-0e7075bba956" frameborder="0" width="650" height="380"></iframe></p>
            <p><small>In the above image, we can see that since the first satellite was launched back in 60's there were only few countries that had satellites let alone the capabilities of launcing 
              the satellite with space launch. User can slide the bar to left or right to compare world between 1966 and 2016. In last 4 decades we have seen tremendous growth not only in number of satellies launched by several coutries but also in what purpose 
              these satellites are used for. As of 2016, countries from virtually every continent have their satellite orbiting the earth. We also see the increase in coutries who have
              space launching capabilities as well.
